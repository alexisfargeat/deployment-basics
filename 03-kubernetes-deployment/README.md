# 🧱 Container Orchestration

Welcome to the **Container Orchestration** section.

In this part, we focus on how to manage containerized applications effectively — not just running containers, but organizing them at scale using orchestration tools and patterns.

## 🔍 Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Docker (containers, images, Docker CLI)
- Basic terminal usage
- Some YAML reading/writing

## 🧭 Goals

By the end of this section, you should understand:

- How container images are managed and distributed (registries, versioning, layers)
- The key concepts and architecture of **Kubernetes**
- How microservices interact and scale, using tools like **service meshes**

This content is structured into multiple focused guides:
