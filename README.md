# Deployment basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the Deployment Basics repository. This repository contains resources and guides for learning how to deploy applications to production environments, starting from making a Dockerfile for an existing app to deploying it on Kubernetes. Some knowledge around development is recommended.

In this repository, you will find ressources to learn about :

### Containerization with Docker

Learn how to package your applications into containerized environments:

- Creating Dockerfiles
